# ANC_nlms
Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) in Verilog using an LMS-based FIR filter. The design adapts filter coefficients in real time to remove reference noise from a desired signal. Includes a testbench that reads input signals from memory, applies delay, and writes the cleaned output for evaluation.
